# Development Best Practices for Jaspersoft Visualize Components Repository

## Yarn/NPM Run Tasks
* If there is a task with a command `yarn workspaces run <task>`, it should be implemented in all packages
* Currently, each package should define these top level tasks
  * `clean` - removes any files generated by automated build processes (e.g: dist/, build/)
  * `build` - builds or bundles package
  * `test` - runs unit tests for package
* In the future more top level tasks may be added to the package.json in the repo root directory
* **Note**: It is preferable to use `yarn` to have the same lockfile for all packages

## Branching Strategy
* Features should be developed in feature branches named after the task at hand
* Branches can be merged once they have
  * Approved in code review
  * Passing github actions
* **Note**: Do not commit directly to main.

## GitHub Actions
* GitHub Actions are performed with every pull request created, and every merge into ‘main’
* Currently, GitHub Actions will run build, test and clean on every package
* If your package has an automated task to verify with each build, feel free to add a github action for it
